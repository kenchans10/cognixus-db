# cognixus-db

There is two application which is this application and another one is DB. I separate this two for easier to troubleshoot if there is any error.

The application can be download from :-

After complete pull this two application. You have to run cognixus-db first before run cognixus project.

If there is changes in DB you can make changes in docker-compose.yml

2) go for terminal
